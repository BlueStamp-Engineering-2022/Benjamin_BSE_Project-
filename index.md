# Synthesizer 
Sends and receives MIDI messages to your PC, allowing direct control of your software. Not only that, but the controls can generally be mapped to anything your like. So what might be a volume fader for one person can be an effect filter for another.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone consists of the same elements of the first milestone except instead of 2 buttons and 1 potentiometer the circuit conists of 12 buttons and 4 potentiometers. Then for the encasing of the whole MIDI controller I use a plastic box and cut holes for where the components will fit into. The schematic for which I used to cut holes is posted in my github repository. I chose to ignore two of the knob potentiometer holes to cut.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was creating the basic circuit for the MIDI controller. This circuit contained 2 buttons, a slide potentiometer, and a knob potentiometer. I also utilized a Arduino Leonardo and code found on the internet located in my github to program inputs into MIDI signals.

# Starter Project 

Using the basics of soldering and electrical engineering I created the useless machine, which flicks off the switch everytime the switch is flipped on. The useless machine utilizes a motor, battery pack, LED, PCB board, resistors, and switches.
